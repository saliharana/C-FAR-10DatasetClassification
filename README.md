# CIFAR-10DatasetClassification
In this repository, I compared the performance of different machine learning methods on the popular Cifar10 image classification dataset. The Cifar10 dataset consists of 32x32 pixel color images belonging to 10 different object classes:
Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck

This widely-used image classification dataset serves as an important benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms.

In the project, I used traditional machine learning algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier. Additionally, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which has become increasingly popular for image processing and classification tasks.

The results showed that the CNN model significantly outperformed the traditional algorithms on the Cifar10 classification task. This demonstrated the superior capability of deep learning-based models for tackling complex image classification problems compared to traditional methods.
