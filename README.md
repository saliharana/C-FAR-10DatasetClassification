# C-FAR-10DatasetClassification
In this repository, I compared the performance of different machine learning methods on the Cifar10 image classification dataset. I used traditional algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier. Additionally, I developed a high-performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
